Quarnix Protocol – Whitepaper

Gasless Layer-2 for Instant Transactions & Seamless Web3 Adoption


1. Introduction

Quarnix is a next-generation Layer-2 protocol designed to eliminate transaction fees, reduce latency, and provide seamless cross-chain interoperability. With a hybrid architecture leveraging zk-Rollups and Optimistic Scaling, Quarnix empowers developers and users alike to experience secure, scalable, and frictionless Web3 adoption.



2. Problem Statement

Despite the growth of blockchain technology, many challenges remain:

- **Complex User Experience**: Web3 onboarding is difficult for non-tech users.
- **High Gas Fees**: Transactions on Layer-1 networks are often expensive.
- **Slow Transaction Finality**: Delays occur with complex operations.
- **Poor Interoperability**: Isolated blockchains lack seamless interaction.



3. Our Solution – Quarnix Protocol

- **Zero Gas Fee for Users**: Meta-transactions and relayer infrastructure cover fees on behalf of users.
- **Fast Finality & Modular Design**: Designed for speed with upgradeable modular components.
- **ZK-Enhanced Security**: Scalable, private, and verifiable using zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Native integration with Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Solana (planned).
- **Token Utility ($QRX)**: Used for governance, backend gas subsidies, and staking.



4. Key Components

- **Hybrid Execution Layer**: Combines zk-Rollups for integrity and optimistic strategies for speed.
- **Decentralized Relayer Network**: Handles transaction fees transparently for users.
- **Gas Subsidy Pool**: Funded via staking and DAO mechanisms to sustain gasless operations.



5. Tokenomics (QRX Token)

- **Governance**: Proposals and protocol upgrades.
- **Fee Subsidy**: Funds gas costs via relayer incentive model.
- **Staking**: For validators and relayers.
- **Rewards**: For early adopters and active users.
